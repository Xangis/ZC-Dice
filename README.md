# ZC-Dice

A simple die roll simulator for Windows. This app was originally 
published on http://zetacentauri.com and was downloaded more than
13,000 times before being open-sourced.

You can use this app to simulate any kind of die roll, whether it be 3d6,
1d30, or 100d2. However, an excessive number of dice will scroll off the
edge. You can drag the corner of the dialog to resize it if you need to.

A prebuilt Windows installer is available in the installer directory:

Requires the .NET framework v3.5 or newer.

## Development Status

I consider this app to be finished and it is no longer under active
development. I am willing to accept pull requests if you have improvements
to contribute.
